    <h2>Photograph</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>[Verse 1]<br/>
    Lovin' can hurt<br/>
    Lovin' can hurt sometimes<br/>
    But it's the only thing that I know<br/>
    And when it gets hard<br/>
    You know it can get hard sometimes<br/>
    It is the only thing that makes us feel alive<br/>
  </li>

    <li>[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
      We keep this love in a photograph<br/>
      We made these memories for ourselves<br/>
      Where our eyes are never closin'<br/>
      Hearts are never broken<br/>
      And time's forever frozen still<br/>
    </li>

      <li>[Chorus]<br/>
        So you can keep me<br/>
        Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br/>
        Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet<br/>
        You won't ever be alone<br/>
        Wait for me to come home<br/>
      </li>

        <li>[Verse 2]<br/>
          Lovin' can heal<br/>
          Lovin' can mend your soul<br/>
          And it's the only thing that I know, know<br/>
          I swear it will get easier<br/>
          Remember that with every piece of ya<br/>
          Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br/>
        </li>

          <li>[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
            Mm, we keep this love in this photograph<br/>
            We made these memories for ourselves<br/>
            Where our eyes are never closin'<br/>
            Hearts were never broken<br/>
            And time's forever frozen still<br/>
          </li>
            
            <li>[Chorus]<br/>
              So you can keep me<br/>
              Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br/>
              Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet<br/>
              You won't ever be alone<br/>
              And if you hurt me<br/>
              Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed<br/>
              Inside these pages, you just hold me<br/>
              And I won't ever let you go<br/>
              Wait for me to come home<br/>
            </li>

              <li>[Bridge]<br/>
                Wait for me to come home<br/>
                Wait for me to come home<br/>
                Wait for me to come home<br/>
              </li>

                <li>[Chorus]<br/>
                  Oh, you can fit me<br/>
                  Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen<br/>
                  Next to your heartbeat, where I should be<br/>
                  Keep it deep within your soul<br/>
                  And if you hurt me<br/>
                  Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed<br/>
                  Inside these pages, you just hold me<br/>
                  And I won't ever let you go<br/>
                </li>

                  <li>[Outro]<br/>
                    When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me<br/>
                    Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street<br/>
                    Hearin' you whisper through the phone<br/>
                    "Wait for me to come home"<br/>
                  </li>
